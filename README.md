# Wine_Quality_Prediction
This is a project based on machine learning model to predict the quality of wine
For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:
<ul>
<li>Fixed acidity</li>
<li>Volatile acidity</li>
<li>Citric acid</li>
<li>Residual sugar</li>
<li>Chlorides</li>
<li>Free sulfur dioxide</li>
<li>Total sulfur dioxide</li>
<li>Density</li>
<li>pH</li>
<li>Sulfates</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
</ul>
